## Exercise 1 / Dynamic Filtering

- Create a brand new React application with 'Create React App' by running "create-react-app ex01" in the terminal from 03_react/block05 folder.

Inside main functional component (App.js) create a form that contains an input and a button.

We are going to use the input to enter a category name and display all products belonging to this category.

**Requirements**

- The list of products will be an array of objects, use the one from the previous exercises ( also below ). Feel free to add more products following the same format but do not delete or modify the 3 products which are already there

- Initially you should display the list of all products.

- Each product should render _at least_ its name, name of category and price

- If there are no products in this category show 'No products found'.

- By typing 'all' in the input we should be able to see the entire list of products again from all the categories.
